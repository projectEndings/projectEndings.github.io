## Endings Humanities Faculty ##

### Claire Carlin ###
#### Le Mariage sous l’Ancien Régime (Marriage in Early Modern France) ####

A specialist in Early Modern French studies, **Claire Carlin** (PhD, University of California) has been a faculty member at UVic from 1989-2015. Her major publications focus on the history of theatre and on representations of Early Modern marriage. Her specializations include 17th-century theatre, history of marriage in the 16th-18th centuries, digital humanities, and feminist theory.

Her research projects include the following:

**Representations of marriage in early modern France**
[Le Mariage sous l’Ancien Régime](http://mariage.uvic.ca) is an ongoing digital anthology and scholarly edition funded by SSHRC 2001-2004, 2007-2013\. Besides numerous articles on this topic, she delivered keynote addresses to the Société pour l’Analyse de la Topique Romanesque (SATOR), Université de Paris VII, in 2007 and to the joint conference of the Société d’étude du XVIIe siècle, the British Society for Seventeenth-Century French Studies, the North American Society for Seventeenth-Century French Literature and the Centre international de rencontres sur le XVIIe siècle at Oxford University in 2006. She also edited _Le Mariage sous l’Ancien Régime_, special issue of _Dalhousie French Studies_, 56, fall 2001.

She has edited Pierre Corneille’s _La Veuve_ and _La Suivante_ for the _Théâtre complet_, vol. I. She has published monographs on Corneille’s theatre in 2000 (_Women Reading Corneille: Feminist Psychocriticisms of_ Le Cid) and 1998 (_Pierre Corneille Revisited_).

**History of Medicine** – _Imagining Contagion in Early Modern Europe_ (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2005) was the result of a project she led where each contribution was discussed in depth by the team in a meeting in 2003\. This project was funded by SSHRC and the Hannah Foundation for the History of Medicine.

**Representations of women in 17th-century France**
Ongoing work on _préciosité_, women as writers and readers.

### Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins ###
#### The Nxa’amxcin Database and Dictionary ####

**Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins** (PhD, MIT) is a professor in the University of Victoria’s Department of Linguistics. Her research focuses primarily on Salish languages, and much of her work as a linguist has been as an ally supporting language revitalization efforts in several Salish communities.

Her current work includes participation in a project that examines patterns of intonation in four Salish languages: one project aim is the development of a toolkit for describing and teaching intonation effectively. She is also involved in the construction of **a dictionary and online database of Nxaʔamxčín, an Interior Salish language.** The digital component of that project additionally forms one of the case studies of Project Endings, a SSHRC-funded investigation of how to make digital projects in the humanities more sustainable.

Czaykowska-Higgins says languages have been an abiding interest, in part because she comes from an immigrant-settler family (her native language is Polish). “I just love patterns in language. Languages are so deeply interesting in and of themselves. It’s not something that most people realize because we use language unconsciously. But when you start to look deeper into how languages work, it’s just fascinating.”

And as a linguist, she understands that language is at the core of who we are and how we identify ourselves. “It’s connected to the land, it’s connected to our history, it’s key to a lot of political issues—even our _spirituality_ is in language. It’s so central to who we are as human beings.”
