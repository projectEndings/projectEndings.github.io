We're pleased to announce the launch of our new website in anticipation for a busy year in 2019. This site designed using the "beautiful-jekyll" theme by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/) and consists of a series of flat Markdown files that are rendered as HTML by our host, Github pages. 

Our old site and link structure is still available at [https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/endingsproject/](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/endingsproject/)

If you are interested in static sites with Jekyll and Github page, see this tutorial at the [Programming Historian](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages).
