We're pleased to announce the launch of our new website in anticipation for a busy year in 2019. This site designed using the beautiful-jekyll theme by [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/), which is hosted at Github pages. 

Our old site and link structure is still available at [https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/endingsproject/](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca/endingsproject/)
