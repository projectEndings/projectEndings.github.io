**How do and how should DH projects conclude?**

The Endings Project is a 4-year project funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council ([SSHRC](http://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/)) that is creating tools, principles, policies and recommendations for digital scholarship practicioners to create accessible, stable, long-lasting resources in the humanities.

Some of the quesitions we are attempting to answer include "how should we preserve projects to retain their dynamic features" & "where should projects be archived?" To learn more about us, visit our [About Page](./about.md).
